# Fluent Bit Integration Guide

This guide outlines the steps to integrate Fluent Bit for log management in your Kubernetes environment, focusing on middleware and local-controller logs.

## 1. Introduction to Logging

- **Categories**: INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, and CRITICAL.
- **Implementation**: Logging statements added in both the controller and middleware.
- **Logging Level**: Set to DEBUG for comprehensive log collection.
- **Log Files**: Individual `out.log` files for middleware and controller.

## 2. Setting Up Fluent Bit

Install and set up Fluent Bit using Helm with the following commands:

```bash
# Install Helm
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

# Add the Fluent Helm Charts repo
helm repo add fluent https://fluent.github.io/helm-charts

# Install default Fluent Bit chart
